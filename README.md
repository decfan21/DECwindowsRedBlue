# DECwindowsRedBlue
A DECwindows inspired Xfwm4 theme with red and blue accents. The Gtk3 themes are not mine. It's FlatSurfaces with a few colors modified to better match the WM themes. You can find the original here: https://github.com/cat-in-136/FlatSurfacesTheme

To install this theme just drop each of the four folders into .themes (your user only) or /usr/share/themes (system-wide). The panelbg images are meant to be used as the background images for the panel. They're 22 pixels tall. The filler image is transparent and replaces the icons for the panel menus I have on my setup. The menu don't seem to support text only labels, so this is a quick workaround. 

UI font is SGI: https://www.dafontfree.net/freefonts-sgi-f140002.htm
